# CoronaFramer
Easily generate U.S COVID-19 DataFrames with customizable census data

This software uses [COVID-19 data from the New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) and data collected from the 2018 American Community Survey
from the U.S Census. This allows for the easy creation of powerful data sets. This software can write CSV files for importation into statistical packages as well
as store the data in a pandas DataFrame for analysis within python
